Includes program files for The Gaming Hub project design template.

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
- The Gaming Room is the creator of the hit mobile game Draw it or Lose it. They wished for us to develop a web based game application that integrated with their mobile game, and allowed PC/MAC/Linux players to also play their game.
- The game was to utilize user profiles to maintain player profiles, while starting games within teams. There were 2 teams per game, and the game drew from a list of redefined images for the team to work out what the image is.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
- The part I had the best time with was the domain model and creating the UML. While the whole document required revisions upon review, this portion I had the best understanding over.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
- The UML and domain model were the biggest help. Being able to put the classes and required program files into a UML drawing made it 10x easier to figure out what would need to be coded and integrated into the program.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would certainly pick the evaluations table to redo some more. My grasp on the different operating systems is weaker than I thought it was, in the sense of how they are used for client/server development. I would take more time to research the flaws and bonuses of each OS
- and try and truly grasp what the necessary pros/cons are of each. Upon this, I would completely revise my approach on the tables, and change the loose, nonconnecting paragraphs I do have into something more cohesive.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- By putting myself in the shoes of the User, I made it easy to see what would need to be implemented into the design. How would I go about with this game software? What would I need to ensure my profile is made, what security
- I would want to ensure my user profile was good. What the game would need to look like... and so forth. Putting your self in their shoes and seeing your program as a User, is a huge tool to utilize when developing software.
- At the end of the day and the program is released, the user is going to be the 1 that interacts with your program the most, and is ultimately the 1 that will generate the revenue for you or pay for your product. So, ensuring the user
- needs are met is pivotal in successful programming.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- First was visualizing what I would want the software to do and look like. Then, you build off that with necessary object files, class files and so forth. Afterwards you develop the main integrating files to tie up and get a good overall program
- A good technique is drawing out on paper all the necessary tools and features you want for your program or that you believe the user would want with your program. Just jumping into coding will lead to unfinished projects or terriblyt written programs.
- This is something I do not really like to do, but as I have gone through and failed with my current 2 courses (B and A- isn't failing in the academic sense, but it is for me), I am realizing doing this and incorporating more time into the design process
- is necesssary for a programmer/designers success.
